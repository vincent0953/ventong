          <p>The history of Bayawan dates back to the establishment of a Spanish settlement by friars in 1751. Originally known as Tolong Nuevo, the area existed as early as 1868 as part of Tolong Viejo, which is now the Municipality of Sta. Catalina. It wasn't until 1872 that Tolong Nuevo was formally organized into a pueblo, marking the beginning of Bayawan's official establishment.</p>
